>"There are more things in the Undervoid, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."

Undervoid is a very-much-under-development dungeon crawler/bullet hell/rpg lite experience being developed with pygame. Choose one of several wacky characters (currently there's just one) and venture, in search of glory and treasure, into the Undervoid, an interdemensional rift beneath the world where the laws of nature and time lose all meaning and enemies lurk around every corner. 

## Requirements

python 3.7+ (I ran into some odd behavior testing with python 3.5 and 3.6)  
pipenv

## Run
Undervoid is developed to utilize pipenv, which takes care of dependencies for you. To install pipenv, run:  
`pip3 install --user pipenv`. 

Refer to https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv for more information on installing pipenv. 

Once you've cloned the repository and installed pipenv, you can install dependencies with:  
`pipenv install`

Then, you can run Undervoid with:  
`pipenv run python3 main.py`
